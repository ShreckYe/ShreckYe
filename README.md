### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am Yongshun "Shreck" Ye

I am a Kotlin full-stack developer and a programming language theory / type theory enthusiast.
<!--
**ShreckYe/ShreckYe** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on full-stack multiplatform app development with [Kotlin Multiplatform](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform.html) (mainly [Vert.x](https://vertx.io/) and [Compose Multiplatform](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/compose-multiplatform/)) in @huanshankeji.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning programming language theory and category theory, taking Haskell, Agda, and Arend as my main tools. <!-- To be more precise, I am now studying Category Theory for Programmers I, II, and III by Bartosz Milewski, [Cubical Agda](https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/language/cubical.html), and [Arend Tutorial](https://arend-lang.github.io/documentation/tutorial). -->
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on developing multiplatform applications and open-source libraries with Kotlin full-stack technologies. Check out @huanshankeji for our open-source projects and contact me if you are interested in our apps.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about full-stack app development with Kotlin, JVM development, programming languages, and proof assistants.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: send me an email at shreckye[at]gmail[dot]com.
