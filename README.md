### Hi there 👋 I am Yongshun "Shreck" Ye

I am a Kotlin full-stack developer and a programming language theory (functional programming, type theory, formal math, etc.) enthusiast.
<!--
**ShreckYe/ShreckYe** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->

- 🔭 I’m currently working on full-stack multiplatform app development with [Kotlin Multiplatform](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform.html) and [Vert.x](https://vertx.io/) in [@huanshankeji](https://github.com/huanshankeji).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning programming language theory and category theory, taking Haskell, Agda, Lean 4, and Arend as my main tools. <!-- To be more precise, I am now studying Category Theory for Programmers I, II, and III by Bartosz Milewski, [Cubical Agda](https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/language/cubical.html), and [Arend Tutorial](https://arend-lang.github.io/documentation/tutorial). -->
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on developing multiplatform applications and open-source libraries with Kotlin full-stack technologies. Check out [@huanshankeji](https://github.com/huanshankeji) for our open-source projects and contact me if you are interested in our apps.
- 💬 Ask me or communicate with me about full-stack app development with Kotlin, JVM development (Kotlin, Scala, and Java), build tools such as Gradle, programming languages, and proof assistants.
- 📫 How to reach me: send me an email at shreckye[at]gmail[dot]com.
