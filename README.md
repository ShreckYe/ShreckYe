**ShreckYe/ShreckYe** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->

- 🔭 I’m currently working on efficient full stack app development primarily on the JVM with Kotlin and Scala.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning functional programming and type theory, taking Haskell, Agda, and Arend as my main tools. To be more precise, I am now studying category theory, [PLFA](https://plfa.github.io/), and [Arend Tutorial](https://arend-lang.github.io/documentation/tutorial).
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on Kotlin full stack development in Chengdu.
- 💬 Ask me about full stack app development with Kotlin, programming languages, along with mathematics and logic and their formalization.
